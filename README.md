# Kubernetes Event Scraper

This document explains the concept and steps we followed to create a Python application that runs as a pod in a Kubernetes cluster, parses events from it, and sends these events to an external service.

## Concept

The main idea is to create a Python application that uses the Kubernetes client library to watch for events in a Kubernetes cluster. When a new event occurs, the application sends a POST request with the event data to an external service.

## Steps

1. **Creating the Python Application**: We created a Python application using the Kubernetes client library. The application watches for events in the Kubernetes cluster and sends a POST request with the event data to an external service when a new event occurs.

2. **Dockerizing the Application**: We created a Dockerfile for the application and built a Docker image. The Docker image contains the Python application and its dependencies.

3. **Creating a Kubernetes Deployment**: We created a Kubernetes Deployment to run the application in the Kubernetes cluster. The Deployment creates a Pod that runs the Docker image we built.

4. **Creating a Kubernetes Service**: We created a Kubernetes Service to expose the application inside the Kubernetes cluster. The Service routes traffic to the Pod created by the Deployment.

5. **Creating a Kubernetes ServiceAccount**: We created a Kubernetes ServiceAccount and assigned it to the Pod. The ServiceAccount provides an identity for the application and allows it to interact with the Kubernetes API.

6. **Monitoring the Application with Prometheus**: We used Prometheus to monitor the application. The application uses the Prometheus Python client to expose metrics in the Prometheus format. These metrics include:

    - `request_processing_seconds`: A summary metric that measures the time spent processing requests.
    - `events_sent_total`: A counter metric that counts the total number of events sent.

    We created a Prometheus job to scrape these metrics. The job is defined by a `ServiceMonitor` resource, which tells Prometheus how to discover and scrape metrics from the application. The `ServiceMonitor` matches the labels of the application's service and specifies the port where the application exposes its metrics.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, we were able to create a Python application that runs in a Kubernetes cluster, parses events from the cluster, and sends these events to an external service. We also set up monitoring for the application using Prometheus. The application exposes metrics that provide insights into its performance and behavior, and Prometheus scrapes these metrics and provides a time-series database where they can be queried and visualized.
